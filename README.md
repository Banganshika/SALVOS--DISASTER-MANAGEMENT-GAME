region of northeast India is high. At the end of the game, students will be given feedback based
on their game scores. The game will focus on the teaching of both prevention (pre-disaster
stage) and survival during the landslide. The game will focus on learning through visualization
and simulation. The game scoring will be based on the activity player performs and its
correctness according to scientifically proven ways.
